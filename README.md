**QuickPath - Save and replay favorite URL paths across tabs**

QuickPath lets you save and replay just the path portion of any URL (for example /dashboard, /login, /logs/view) across all open tabs in your current window. It’s perfect for developers, content editors, system engineers, QA engineers, DevOps engineers, and power users who need to hop between the same route on multiple domains or environments in one click.

**Key Features**

* Save custom URL paths
* Apply a saved path to every open tab in the active window
* Drag & drop to reorder your path list
* Inline edit and delete paths with instant persistence


**How It Works**

1.	Pin the QuickPath icon and click to open the popup
2.	Type or paste a path into the “Add” line and hit Add to save it
3.	Your saved paths appear above (drag the ⋮⋮ handle to reorder)
4.	Click ▶ to update every open tab’s URL to that path
5.	Click 🗑️ to remove a path from your list

**Privacy**

* All data is stored locally in your browser (nothing is sent externally)
